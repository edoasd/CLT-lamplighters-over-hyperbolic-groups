% Hi everybody! 
%I'm trying to uniformize notation and start to make the paper look closer to a "complete" draft. I will start by trying to write down well the preliminaries and notation associated to Matthieu Sisto, and to order the argument in the case of hyperbolic groups that uses pivots (since it is shorter and I think it is a nice first "checkpoint" for the paper). Once we have that I think it will be easier to complete the paper to include the case of acylindrically hyperbolic groups and the argument with the polylog deviation inequalities. Let me know if you have any comments about something that I wrote!

%Eduardo.

	\begin{abstract} 
We prove a central limit theorem for random walks with a finitely supported step distribution on wreath products of the form $A\wr H=\bigoplus_H A\wr H $, where $A$ is a non-trivial finite group and $H$ is a non-elementary hyperbolic group.
