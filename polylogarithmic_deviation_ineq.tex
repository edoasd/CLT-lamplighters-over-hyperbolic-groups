In this section we explain a generalization of \cite[Theorems 4.1 \& 4.2]{MathieuSisto2020} (see Theorem \ref{thm: MS general CLT with constant deviation ineq})

\begin{thm} \label{thm: polylogarithmic MS CLT}
    Suppose that $Q_n$ is a defective adapted cocycle with defect
    \[
       \Phi_{m,n} := Q_n - (Q_m + Z_m Q_{m-n})
    \]
    and suppose that for some fixed polynomial $p$ and $N_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ we have that
    \[
       \E[|\Phi_{m,n}|^2] \le p(\log (n))
    \]
    whenever $m, n-m \ge N_0$.
    Then a CLT holds for $Q_n$.
\end{thm}
\red{Is this the formulation we want?}

Here are the places in the proof of Mathieu-Sisto's CLT where the deviation inequality is used:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item In Theorem 4.4 one obtains $V(Q_n)\le n\Big(p(4 \E(Q_1^2)+ 16\log(n))\Big)$
    \item Then in Lemma 4.5 it is cited a result of Hammersley \cite[Theorem 2]{Hammerslet1962}. This should be replaced by an inequality of the form $a_{n+m}\le a_n+a_m+bp(log(n+m))$.
    \begin{lem}
    	Let $\{a_n\}_{n\ge 0}$ be a sequence of non-negative real numbers. Suppose that there exists $b\ge 0$ and a polynomial $p:\R_{+}\to \R_{+}$ such that 
    	\[
    	a_{n+m}\le a_n+a_m+b\sqrt{p(log(a_n+a_m))}, \text{ for each }m,n\ge 0.
    	\]
    	Then the limit $\lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{a_n}{n}$ exists.
    \end{lem}
    \item The deviation inequality is used in multiple occasions during the proof of Lemma 4.6. One should do the appropriate modifications.
\end{enumerate}
