\section{Introduction}

\begin{enumerate}
\item	Talk about random walks on groups; trying to prove limit laws in general
\item Make a list of things known about lamplighters and why they are relevant
\item Say that in this paper we concentrate on the CLT
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Main results}

Consider the switch-walk-switch word length $|\cdot |$ on $A\wr H$.

\begin{thm}
	Let $A$ be a non-trivial group and $H$ a non-elementary hyperbolic group. Consider a probability measure $\mu$ on $A\wr H$ such that $\mu_H$ is non-elementary and has a finite second moment, and such that $\mu$ has bounded lamp range. Denote by $\{w_n\}_{n\ge 0}$ the $\mu$-random walk on $A\wr H$, and let $C=\lim_{n\to \infty}\frac{\E(|w_n|)}{n}$ be the drift of the $\mu$-random walk on $A\wr B$. Then the sequence of normalized random variables $\frac{|w_n|-Cn}{\sqrt{n}}$, $n\ge 1$, converges in law to a non-degenerate gaussian law.
\end{thm}

\red{What are the moment hypotheses for acylindrically hyperbolic base groups? Finite support? exponential tails?}

We prove a central limit theorem for the range of random walks with a finite second moment on hyperbolic groups.
\begin{thm}\label{thm: CLT range on hyperbolic groups}
	Let $H$ be a non-elementary hyperbolic group and let $\mu$ be a non-elementary probability measure on $H$ with a finite second moment. Let $C$ be the probability that the $\mu$-random walk on $H$ starting at $e_H$ never returns to $e_H$. Then the sequence of normalized random variables $\frac{|R _{n} | - Cn}{\sqrt{n}}$, $n\ge 1$, converges in law to a non-degenerate gaussian law.
\end{thm}
