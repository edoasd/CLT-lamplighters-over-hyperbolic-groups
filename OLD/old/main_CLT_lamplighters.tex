	\maketitle
	\begin{abstract} 
We prove a central limit theorem for random walks on wreath products $A\wr H=\bigoplus_H F\wr H $, where $A$ is a non-trivial group and $H$ is a non-elementary hyperbolic group, for step distributions with a finite second moment and bounded lamp range. Additionally, we prove a central limit theorem for the range of a random walk on a non-elementary hyperbolic group $H$, for step distributions with a finite second moment.
